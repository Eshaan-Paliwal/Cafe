# Sound Effects and 3D Models

To complete the implementation of the animations and interactive features, you'll need to add the following files:

## Sound Files
Create a `/public/sounds` directory and add these sound files:

1. `/public/sounds/click.mp3` - A short click sound for button interactions
2. `/public/sounds/hover.mp3` - A subtle hover sound for interactive elements
3. `/public/sounds/add-to-cart.mp3` - A confirmation sound for adding items to cart
4. `/public/sounds/card-flip.mp3` - A sound for card flipping animations
5. `/public/cafe-ambience.mp3` - Background caf√© ambience with soft music

## 3D Models
Create a `/public/models` directory and add:

1. `/public/models/coffee_cup.glb` - A 3D model of a coffee cup for the cursor-watching feature
