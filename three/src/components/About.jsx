          <p>Founded in 2020, Cozy Corner Café was born from a passion for quality coffee and a desire to create a welcoming space for our community.</p>
          <p>We source our beans from ethical, sustainable farms and roast them in small batches to ensure the freshest coffee experience possible.</p>
          <p>Our team of dedicated baristas are trained to craft the perfect cup, tailored to your preferences.</p>
          <p>Beyond coffee, we're committed to supporting local producers, reducing our environmental footprint, and giving back to our community.</p>
